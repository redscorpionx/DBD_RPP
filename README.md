# Dead By Daylight Random Perk Picker

Implementation of the random perks dbd devs refuse to give us!

## Usage

- This only works on a 1920x1080 resolution.
- Before running the script, make sure you are on the perk selection page of the game.
- When you run the script, you have 5 seconds to click on the game window before the script starts picking random perks.
- The script will pick 4 random perks for you.
- This is the first version of the script, so it is not perfect.
- i tested on survivor only, 9 pages of perks. killer ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
